## REST API
We have the REST API server begun and have it already serving up responses for specific commands, for example:

`repitile_server` debug output

![REST API 1]({{ "/assets/restapi1.png" | absolute_url }})

Requesting the temperature and humidity with `curl`

![REST API 2]({{ "/assets/restapi2.png" | absolute_url }})

Executing these commands from the Python UI is extremely simple, with the help of the `requests` library

```py
response = requests.get("http://localhost:7878/get/temp")
print(response.text)
```

## Continued UI Updates

Progress is being made with the various other screens for the GUI, such as the profile editing screen:
