# RePitile System


This is the website for the [RePitile System Project][repisysproj] which aims to create reliable automatic environment-regulating system for reptile enclosures. The system uses a Raspberry Pi to control the environment and adjust it as necessary to create the proper environment for any reptile. The system is configurable so you can easily switch to a new configuration to meet your reptile's needs in a pinch.
